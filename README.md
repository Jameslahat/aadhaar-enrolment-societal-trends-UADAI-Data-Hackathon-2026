Data-driven analysis of Aadhaar enrolment patterns across age groups, regions, and time to uncover societal trends and actionable insights using UIDAI datasets.
# Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates

## 📌 Overview
Aadhaar is a foundational digital identity system enabling access to public services across India. Despite its widespread adoption, enrolment patterns vary across regions, age groups, and time. This project explores these variations to identify meaningful trends, anomalies, and insights that can support data-driven decision-making and system improvements.

This repository contains a complete exploratory and analytical study conducted as part of the **UIDAI Aadhaar Data Analysis Challenge**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze Aadhaar enrolment trends across age groups (0–5, 5–17, 18+)
- Identify state-wise and district-wise enrolment disparities
- Examine temporal patterns and seasonal enrolment trends
- Detect anomalies and high-impact enrolment regions
- Provide actionable insights for administrative and social impact

## 🧪 Methodology
1. **Data Integration**
   - Combined multiple UIDAI CSV files into a unified dataset

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Date standardization
   - Missing value verification
   - Feature engineering (total enrolments, year, month)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Univariate, bivariate, and trivariate analysis
   - Geographic and demographic segmentation

4. **Visualization**
   - State-wise and age-wise bar charts
   - Time-series trend analysis
   - District-level anomaly identification

## 📈 Key Insights
- Adult (18+) enrolments dominate Aadhaar registrations nationwide
- Urban and highly populated states act as enrolment hubs
- Seasonal spikes indicate the impact of awareness drives and policy initiatives
- Certain districts show anomalously high adult enrolments, suggesting migration or delayed registration patterns

---

## 🧠 Impact & Applicability
- Supports better planning of enrolment centers
- Enables targeted awareness campaigns
- Highlights underserved regions and demographic gaps
- Provides a scalable framework for governance analytics
